Creating a note-keeping app using Flutter with MVVM architecture, SQLite database, and Flutter Provider for state management is a great project idea! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**

Before you begin, make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

**Step 2: Create a New Flutter Project**

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create note_app
```

**Step 3: Add Required Dependencies**

Navigate to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider: ^5.0.0
  sqflite: ^2.0.0
  path: ^1.8.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

**Step 4: Create Folder Structure**

Create a folder structure that follows MVVM principles to organize your code:

- `lib/`
  - `data/`
    - `database/`
    - `models/`
  - `ui/`
    - `views/`
    - `viewmodels/`
    - `widgets/`
  - `main.dart`

**Step 5: Define the Data Model**

Inside the `models` folder, create a file named `note_model.dart`. Define the `Note` data model with the properties you mentioned: id, title, content, and created date.

```dart
class Note {
  final int id;
  final String title;
  final String content;
  final DateTime createdDate;

  Note({required this.id, required this.title, required this.content, required this.createdDate});
}
```

**Step 6: Create Database Helper**

Inside the `database` folder, create a file named `database_helper.dart`. This file will contain the SQLite database setup and CRUD operations.

Define your database schema and create functions to insert, update, delete, and retrieve notes from the database.

**Step 7: Implement the ViewModel**

Inside the `viewmodels` folder, create a file named `note_view_model.dart`. This is where you'll implement the ViewModel using the Provider package. The ViewModel should handle interactions between the UI and the data.

Define functions to fetch notes, add notes, update notes, and delete notes. Use the `ChangeNotifier` class from the Provider package to notify the UI about changes in the data.

**Step 8: Create UI Components**

Inside the `views` folder, create your login and registration pages using Flutter's widgets. You can use `TextFormField`, `ElevatedButton`, and other widgets to create input fields and buttons for user interactions.

**Step 9: Set Up Navigation**

Use Flutter's navigation to navigate between the login, registration, and note-taking screens. You can use `Navigator` or packages like `flutter_bloc` or `riverpod` for more advanced navigation management.

**Step 10: Integrate ViewModel with UI**

In your UI widgets, use the `Provider` package to access the ViewModel and manage the state. Wrap your top-level widget with a `ChangeNotifierProvider` to provide the ViewModel to the widget tree.

**Step 11: Test Your App**

Run your app on an emulator or a physical device to test the functionality of the login, registration, and note-taking screens. Verify that notes are being saved to and retrieved from the SQLite database correctly.

This outline should help you get started on building your note-keeping app with Flutter using MVVM architecture, SQLite database, and Flutter Provider for state management. As you progress, you can refine your code, add more features, and improve the user experience. Remember to refer to the official Flutter documentation and the documentation of the packages you're using for more details on implementation.
